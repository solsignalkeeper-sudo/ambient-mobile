Make the mobile app function exactly like the web app and implement a two screen swipe layout
Core requirement
The mobile app must behave exactly like the existing web app using the same state logic and features
Do not create a separate simplified mobile version
Keep all existing controls and features including Encourage Me button volume sliders voice selector environment selector and timers
Two screen swipe layout
Replace the current navigation with a two page swipe interface like the web app
Screen 1 is Player
Screen 2 is Phrases
User must be able to swipe left and right between the two screens
Keep bottom navigation optional for tapping but swipe must be the primary way
Use a stable lightweight swipe solution such as react swipeable or a minimal custom swipe pager
Avoid hook ordering changes that break hot reload
Fix no sound and make environments match their titles
Currently there is no sound or the sounds do not match the environment
Each environment must have realistic ambient background audio that matches the label and loops continuously
Environments
City
Cafe coffee shop diner
Office work environment
Nature outside rain wind birds
Audio requirements
Use real audio files not synthetic noise
Loop continuously
Loop must be seamless with no obvious restart click or gap
Crossfade when switching environments so it is smooth
Mobile audio requirement
On iOS and mobile browsers audio must only start after a user gesture
Ensure Play button resumes AudioContext and starts playback reliably on mobile
Ambient audio assets
If you cannot source good audio automatically create an assets folder and wire the system so I can upload the audio files
Use multiple layered tracks per environment if possible and mix them with Web Audio API
Do not ship with random weird placeholder sounds
City must sound like traffic distant voices footsteps
Cafe must sound like cups light chatter espresso
Office must sound like typing low chatter printer
Nature must sound like rain wind birds
Voices and personas using ElevenLabs
The encouragement voice must use ElevenLabs voices not browser speech
Voices are selectable on the Player screen
Example voices Sarah George and others
Each voice profile has its own persona style such as wise calming funny hippy supportive
When the user selects a voice the spoken encouragement should use that persona
Ensure the voice sounds natural and immersive and blends into the ambient soundscape
Duck the background slightly during speech then restore after
Phrases and persona libraries
Each voice persona must have at least 30 encouragement phrases
Phrases should be grouped by persona and selectable
User can choose which phrase group is active or choose Custom
Custom phrases must allow add edit delete
Also add an option to upload a list of phrases such as paste multiple lines and import them
Do not remove existing phrase management features keep them and enhance them
Encouragement timing and on demand
Keep frequency selection and timers working
Encourage Me button must trigger an immediate phrase without breaking the scheduled timer
Avoid repeating the same phrase back to back
Validation checklist after changes
Swipe left right switches between Player and Phrases
All controls work on mobile exactly as web
Play button produces ambient sound
Each environment matches its label
Audio loops seamlessly and crossfades on environment change
ElevenLabs voice works and changes when voice is selected
Phrases screen shows persona groups and custom phrases and supports import list
No console errors after a full reload
