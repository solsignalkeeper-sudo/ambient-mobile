Fix the mobile build so it functions exactly like the web app using the same source code and same audio and voice behavior
Current problem
The mobile version does not behave like the web app and key features do not work
The mobile app must use the same React app files as the web app not a separate or simplified screen set
Do not rebuild a second app
Make mobile an exact shell of the existing web app
Navigation requirement
Player and Phrases must be swipe navigation
Implement a two page swipe view where the user can swipe left or right between Player and Phrases
Also keep bottom nav icons as optional tap navigation but swipe must work
Use a simple horizontal swipe pager implementation such as
react swipeable or a minimal custom swipe handler
Do not introduce unstable hook changes
Behavior parity
Player screen must work exactly as web
Audio playback must work
Environment selection must work
Volume sliders must work
Encourage Me button must trigger immediate encouragement and must not break the timer
Voice must work the same as web and use the same voice settings
Phrases screen must allow add edit delete and use the same local storage state as web
Mobile wrapper requirement
If this is being wrapped via Expo Go or a mobile preview
Ensure audio works on mobile browsers and iOS Safari style restrictions
Audio must only start after a user gesture such as pressing play
Ensure the play button triggers the AudioContext resume and starts playback
Ensure the same logic is used in web and mobile builds
Build system consistency
Use the same Vite build output index html root mount and assets
index html uses root div and module script assets
Make sure mobile build points to the same compiled bundle and does not load an outdated cached bundle
If the mobile wrapper is using a different url or build output fix it so it loads the same current deployed build
Bug fix guidance
Avoid hook ordering changes that cause hot reload hook mismatch
If hook count changes require full reload or restart dev server but keep final code stable
Fix any scroll area or tab components that break on mobile
Verify state persistence and that local storage reads and writes work on mobile
Verification checklist
After changes confirm
Swipe left right moves between Player and Phrases
All functions match web app including audio and voice
Encourage Me works on demand
Environment audio matches the selected title
No broken controls in mobile preview
No console errors after a fresh reload
